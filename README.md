key idea: how to select the most helpful knowledge sources for a target task to make best use of multiple available knowledge sources

2. knowledge transfer frenquency could be adjusted

3. knowledge transfer intensities

benchmark is single-objective multitasking test instance.

motivation:
evaluate task relatedness based on both the similarity of their
landscapes and the intersection of the global optima for regulating the knowledge transfer

key idea:

contribution:
1. A PDM technique is proposed to evaluate the degree of task relatedness as the evolution proceeds. 
2. A MKT mechanism with a two-level learning operator is presented to conduct multiple strategies of knowledge transfer across tasks based on the degree of relatedness.
